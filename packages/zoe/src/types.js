/**
 * @typedef {Object} ZoeService
 * Zoe provides a framework for deploying and working with smart contracts. It
 * is accessed as a long-lived and well-trusted service that enforces offer
 * safety for the contracts that use it. Zoe has a single `inviteIssuer` for
 * the entirety of its lifetime. By having a reference to Zoe, a user can get
 * the `inviteIssuer` and thus validate any `invite` they receive from someone
 * else.
 *
 * Zoe has two different facets: the public Zoe service and the contract facet
 * (ZCF). Each contract instance has a copy of ZCF within its vat. The contract
 * and ZCF never have direct access to the users' payments or the Zoe purses.
 * The contract can only do a few things through ZCF. It can propose a
 * reallocation of amount or complete an offer. It can also speak directly to Zoe
 * outside of its vat, and create a new offer for record-keeping and other
 * purposes.
 *
 * @property {() => Issuer} getInviteIssuer
 * Zoe has a single `inviteIssuer` for the entirety of its lifetime.
 * By having a reference to Zoe, a user can get the `inviteIssuer`
 * and thus validate any `invite` they receive from someone else. The
 * mint associated with the inviteIssuer creates the ERTP payments
 * that represent the right to interact with a smart contract in
 * particular ways.
 *
 * @property {(bundle: SourceBundle, moduleFormat?: string) => InstallationHandle} install
 * Create an installation by safely evaluating the code and
 * registering it with Zoe. Returns an installationHandle.
 *
 * @property {(installationHandle: InstallationHandle,
 *             issuerKeywordRecord: IssuerKeywordRecord,
 *             terms?: object)
 *            => Promise<InviteIssuerRecord>} makeInstance
 * Zoe is long-lived. We can use Zoe to create smart contract
 * instances by specifying a particular contract installation to
 * use, as well as the `issuerKeywordRecord` and `terms` of the contract. The
 * `issuerKeywordRecord` is a record mapping string names (keywords) to issuers,
 * such as `{ Asset: simoleanIssuer}`. (Note that the keywords must
 * begin with a capital letter and must be ASCII identifiers.) Parties to the
 * contract will use the keywords to index their proposal and
 * their payments.
 *
 * Terms are the arguments to the contract,
 * such as the number of bids an auction will wait for before closing.
 * Terms are up to the discretion of the smart contract. We get back
 * an invite (an ERTP payment) to participate in the contract.
 *
 * @property {(InstanceHandle) => InstanceRecord} getInstanceRecord
 * Credibly get information about the instance (such as the installation
 * and terms used).

 * @property {(invite: Invite,
 *             proposal?: Proposal,
 *             paymentKeywordRecord?: PaymentKeywordRecord)
 *            => Promise<OfferResultRecord>} offer
 * To redeem an invite, the user normally provides a proposal (their rules for the
 * offer) as well as payments to be escrowed by Zoe.  If either the proposal or payments
 * would be empty, indicate this by omitting that argument or passing undefined, rather
 * than passing an empty record.
 *
 * The proposal has three parts: `want` and `give` are used
 * by Zoe to enforce offer safety, and `exit` is used to specify
 * the particular payout-liveness policy that Zoe can guarantee.
 * `want` and `give` are objects with keywords as keys and amounts
 * as values. `paymentKeywordRecord` is a record with keywords as keys,
 * and the values are the actual payments to be escrowed. A payment
 * is expected for every rule under `give`.

 * issuer successfully withdraws the payment.
 *
 * @property {Promise<OfferOutcome>} outcome Note that if the offerHook throws,
